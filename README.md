<h1>Pengelolaan Data Siswa | Student Data Management</h1>

This is an assignment from my teacher, which is to create a CRUD for student data management using php and ajax.

From this project I learned how to create search and filter features manually using jQuery.

In this project I also applied some oop concepts for connection, select, update and others.
For the frontend I use regular html and css, for the backend I use PHP and jQuery. then for the database using MySQL phpMyAdmin
